# RDP Server Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working (v0.1 - MVP)

### HTTP Transport Integration
- ‚úÖ RDP server properly integrated with HTTP transport mode
- ‚úÖ Lazy initialization solved - eager init when `--rdp` flag is set
- ‚úÖ RDP removed from stdio/sse transports (as per requirements)
- ‚úÖ Server starts alongside HTTP MCP server

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ TCP listener binds to configurable address (default: 127.0.0.1:3389)
- ‚úÖ Concurrent client connections supported (tokio::spawn per client)
- ‚úÖ Configurable FPS for screen capture (default: 15fps)
- ‚úÖ Screen capture working - captures all monitors via `desktop.capture_all_monitors()`
- ‚úÖ RGBA screenshot data available (width, height, pixel data)

### Partial Protocol Implementation
- ‚úÖ X.224 Connection Request/Confirm exchange
- ‚úÖ MCS Connect Initial/Response exchange
- ‚úÖ Basic TCP framing via ironrdp_async::Framed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's NOT Working Yet (Needs Implementation)

### Protocol Completeness
The current implementation has a **partial RDP handshake** but is missing:

1. **TLS Negotiation** (Required)
   - Current code sets `SecurityProtocol::SSL` but doesn't perform TLS handshake
   - Need ironrdp-tls integration with rustls backend
   - Must establish encrypted channel before capability exchange

2. **Capability Exchange** (Required)
   - Client sends capabilities (bitmap formats, compression, etc.)
   - Server must respond with supported capabilities
   - Negotiates screen resolution, color depth, compression algorithms

3. **License Exchange** (Required)
   - RDP license validation/exchange protocol
   - Can use "license not required" mode for internal use

4. **Connection Finalization** (Required)
   - MCS channel joins (I/O, user, etc.)
   - Synchronize PDU exchange
   - Control cooperate/granted PDUs
   - Font map exchange

5. **Bitmap Update PDUs** (Required for Screen Streaming)
   - Convert RGBA screenshots to bitmap format
   - Implement RDP bitmap encoding (RGB565, RGB24, or RGB32)
   - Create UpdatePDU with BitmapData structures
   - Support compression (optional but recommended)
   - Send via fast-path or slow-path updates

### Input Handling
6. **Non-blocking Input PDU Reading** (Required for Control)
   - Current `process_client_input()` is a no-op placeholder
   - Need async polling for incoming PDUs
   - Parse FastPathInput and SlowPathInput PDUs

7. **Mouse Event Processing** (Partially Implemented)
   - Skeleton exists in `handle_mouse_event()`
   - Need to call `desktop.click(x, y)` for clicks
   - Need to implement mouse move if supported by Desktop API

8. **Keyboard Event Processing** (Partially Implemented)
   - Skeleton exists in `handle_keyboard_event()`
   - Need scancode-to-keyname mapping (US keyboard layout minimum)
   - Need to call `desktop.press_key(key_name)` for key presses
   - Support modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift)

## üéØ Why This Implementation Exists

This is an **experimental MVP** to demonstrate:
1. ‚úÖ RDP server can be integrated with HTTP transport
2. ‚úÖ Screen capture works and can be accessed at configurable FPS
3. ‚úÖ Infrastructure is in place for a full RDP server

However, **implementing a fully-functional RDP server is complex** and would require:
- 300-500 additional lines of protocol-specific code
- Extensive testing with Microsoft RDP client
- Understanding of RDP specification nuances

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Full RDP Implementation (High Effort)
If you want a working RDP server that Microsoft RDP client can connect to:

1. **Study IronRDP Examples**
   - Look at ironrdp repository examples
   - Understand complete connection flow
   - Copy capability exchange patterns

2. **Implement Missing Protocol Steps**
   - Add TLS handshake after MCS connect
   - Implement capability exchange
   - Add license exchange (can use no-license mode)
   - Complete connection finalization sequence

3. **Implement Bitmap Updates**
   - Convert RGBA to RGB24/RGB32 format
   - Create BitmapUpdatePDU structures
   - Send updates via fast-path PDU

4. **Complete Input Handling**
   - Parse input PDUs from client
   - Forward mouse/keyboard to Desktop API

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days of focused development

### Option B: Use VNC Instead (Pragmatic Alternative)
VNC protocol is simpler and has better Rust libraries:
- Replace IronRDP with `vnc-rs` crate
- Much simpler protocol (no TLS negotiation, simpler handshake)
- Easier bitmap encoding
- Still achieves goal of remote viewing/control

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

### Option C: Deploy Current MVP for Testing (Quick Win)
Deploy current implementation to Azure VM to test:
1. HTTP MCP server works
2. RDP server accepts connections
3. Screen capture is functional
4. Document what works vs what doesn't

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

## üöÄ Testing the Current MVP

### Build and Run
```bash
# Install CMake (required for rustls dependency)
# On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install cmake
# On macOS: brew install cmake
# On Windows: Install from https://cmake.org/download/

# Build with RDP feature
cargo build --release --features rdp

# Run HTTP server with RDP
./target/release/terminator-mcp-agent -t http --rdp --rdp-bind 0.0.0.0:3389 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

### What You Can Test
1. **HTTP MCP Server**: Connect to http://localhost:3000/mcp
2. **RDP TCP Connection**: Connect Microsoft RDP client to localhost:3389
3. **Logs**: Check for "Screen capture successful" messages (proves capture works)

### What Won't Work (Yet)
- RDP client won't complete connection (missing protocol steps)
- No screen streaming (bitmap updates not sent)
- No input control (input processing not implemented)
