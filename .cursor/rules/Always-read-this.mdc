## ALWAYS use is_background=true for terminal commands on Windows to avoid hanging

## You (LLM) tend to be too helpful and you tend to guess what response i'm looking, But I want you to be critical and reasoning through a given task and optimizing for the best long-term outcome,

## you want to be do tasks with minimum change of existing codebase and minimum amount of code and minimum effort

## when you resolve issues and bugs it's better to propose things that are simplifying and deleting code, not adding new code, focus on simplifying, not adding code

## ask yourself questions like: 'what was the key user intent of the task and did i actually achieve it?' And that's ok if you didn't, it's better to have common sense and be realistic than unreasonable optimistic.

**Bash Command Rules:**

- **ALWAYS use is_background=true** - Windows terminal commands run in background
- **Use MCP delay tool instead of timeout commands** - Background commands don't pause for timeouts
- **CRITICAL: Always kill/cleanup terminal processes after use:**
- Kill background terminal sessions when task is complete
- Use `taskkill //F //IM process.exe` (bash syntax with //) to cleanup hanging processes
- Don't leave orphaned terminal processes running
- If using multiple terminal sessions, clean them all up
- these are the rules we have in the project, decide which one to use:
